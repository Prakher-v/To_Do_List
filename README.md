# To_Do_List

 â€“ Windows Forms To-Do List Application
ToDoListApp is a simple yet functional desktop-based To-Do List application built using C# and Windows Forms (WinForms). This project demonstrates core concepts of Windows GUI development and showcases fundamental programming principles like event handling, list management, and user input validation in a desktop environment.

The application allows users to:

Add new tasks through a clean and intuitive interface.

View a list of all pending tasks in a scrollable ListBox.

Delete selected tasks from the list with a single click.

Unlike command-line apps, this project offers a user-friendly graphical interface, making it more accessible and practical for daily task management. It is ideal for beginners exploring Windows Forms development and looking to understand how desktop applications handle real-time user interactions.

The application was built using the .NET 6 SDK and is fully runnable in both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. This makes it platform-flexible for development and testing on modern Windows environments.
